cd Fugu
pip install --upgrade .
```

An alternative way to install for development (using anaconda environments, python3)
```
conda create -n fugu anaconda
conda activate fugu
git clone git@cee-gitlab.sandia.gov:nerl/Fugu.git
cd Fugu
pip install -r requirements3.txt
pip install -e .
```

# Fugu Notes

Please see the provided example(s). 

## Scaffold

The `Scaffold` object is a graph that contains bricks at each node.  In reality, the Scaffold is only responsible for the organization of bricks.  All functionality is held in the bricks themselves.

### Scaffold.add_brick(self, brick_function, input_nodes=[-1], dimensionality = default_brick_dimensionality, name=None)

## Bricks

Each `Brick` represents one computational function.  Bricks are attached to a Scaffold.  Bricks have certain key properties:

- dimensionality:  A dictionary containing information such as the input and output sizes, circuit depth (if defined), and the types of codings.
- self.supported_codings:  A list of supported codings for this brick. A complete list of codings is avialable at input_coding_types .   
- is_built:  A simple boolean saying whether or not the brick as been built
- name: A string representing the brick

### Brick.build(self, graph, dimensionality, complete_node, input_lists, input_codings)

This function forms the section of the graph corresponding to the brick.

Input parameters:
- graph: graph that is being built
- dimensionality: dictionary containing relevant dimensionality information
- control_nodes: A list of dictionaries of neurons that transmit control signals. A 'done' signal (Generally one from each input) is included in `control_nodes[i]['complete']`.
- input_lists: A list of lists of input neurons.  Each neuron is marked with a local index used for encodings.
- input_codings: A list of types of input codings.  See input_coding_types

Output:
A tuple (graph, dimensionality, complete_node, output_lists, output_codings)
- graph: Graph that is being built
- dimensionality: Dictionary containing relevant dimensionality information
- complete_node: A list of neurons that transmists a 'done' signal (Generally one for each output)
- output_lists: A list of lists of output neurons.  Each neuron is marked with a local index used for encodings.
- output_codings: A list of types of codings.  See input_coding_types

### Details on `control_nodes`
We've seen through experience that it can be extremely helpful to have neurons relay control 
information between bricks.  These neurons should be included in the `control_nodes`.  Regular 
rules apply to these neurons (e.g. naming must be globally unique and indices are locally unique).

`control_nodes` is a *list* of *dictionaries*.  Each entry in the list corresponds with 
an input (if calling `Brick.build`) or an output (if returning from `Brick.build`). 

| Key | Required | Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 'complete' | All Inputs/Outputs | A neuron that fires when a brick is done processing. |
| 'begin' | Temporally-coded Inputs/Outputs | A neuron that fires when a brick begins providing output. |

## Documentation
Documentation is currently spread across several files.  We are working on including docstrings on all the classes and methods.

For now, you can check:
- This README.md
- docs.md
- Ipython notebook examples
- For details on ds, check the README.md of the ds_simulator package

To build the documentation, use pydocmd https://pypi.org/project/pydoc-markdown/ with a command similar to 
`pydocmd simple fugu++ > docs.md`

## Dependencies

- Numpy
- Scipy
- NetworkX
- Pandas
- Pytorch (for DS)

- Combine and organize documentation
- ~~Inputs that take both pre-computed values and input spikes will not lay correctly.~~
- ~~Nodes only accept input from the first output of an input node.~~
- ~~`_create_ds_injection` only works on vector-shaped input~~
- ~~`_create_ds_injection` only works on input layers with 1 input (this may be okay)~~
- ~~Input handling needs to be re-written.  Currently relies on fragile order of nodes.  Additionally, we should support streaming data.~~
- Many checks are missing
- Mismatch between input and output layer namings.  Bricks should be able to be input and/or hidden and/or output layers.
- Maximum runtime should be determined by the depth of the graph.
- Delay brick needs to be updated as well as conversion bricks
- `Scaffold.resolve_timing` needs to be re-tested with new Delay brick
- ~~Dimensionliaty dictionary should be removed~~
- ~~Inputs/Outputs should be bundled as a list of dictionaries rather than parallel lists~~
- ~~Plotting functions likely do not and wll need to be re-tested~~ Vis is being re-written completely.
- Bricks in brick_1.py are likely broken and will need to be fixed.
- ~~Srideep: document fugu.py code bricks~~
- ~~Frances: documention around neural model Fugu is running (e.g. reference manual describing what is actually running)~~
- ~~Brad: focus on Fugu story (ICONS paper and Random Walk example)~~
- ~~Not Sam: Serious issues regarding how backend handles inputs~~
- Not Sam: Need scaffolds to be bricks
- ~~Not Sam: Redo how handle control nodes (Perphaps use dictionaries)~~
- ~~Expand outputs~~ 
- ~~Create backend class to handle backend simulators~~
- ~~Create installer for fugu~~
