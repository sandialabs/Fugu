    "Here's a quick run-down of the fugu objects we use here:\n",
    "- `Scaffold`:  The scaffold object is a container/graph object that organizes and holds computational nodes called 'bricks'.  Various types of bricks can be combined to construct a more sophisticated algorithm.  `Scaffold` is the main object for end-users.  The general workflow is something like this:\n",
    "    1. Define a `Scaffold` object\n",
    "    2. Attach bricks to the `Scaffold`, linking them together\n",
    "    3. 'Build' the computational graph by calling `Scaffold.lay_bricks`\n",
    "    4. Call `Scaffold.evaluate` and perform any post-processing to your answer.\n",
    "A few todo-type caveats:  \n",
    "    1. The `Scaffold` object should, itself, be a `Brick`.  This is critical but unfortunately currently missing.\n",
    "    2. Inputs that take both pre-computed values and input spikes will not lay correctly.\n",
    "    3. Nodes only accept input from the first output of an input node.\n",
    "    4. The code is missing a large portion of expected 'checks' so right now it is on the user to determine if they are doing something allowed or disallowed.\n",
    "    5. Brad kindly provided some code to determine how to add delays so that you can synchronize portions of the Scaffold.  I, rudely, broke this code.  Specifically, I believe the `Scaffold.resolve_timings` function should still work, but the underlying brick will not build correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Spike_Input`: A `Brick` that provides spike inputs in the form of vectors.  For a single input, a numpy array (as you see below) is sufficient.  For inputs at various timesteps, use the flag `time_dimension`.  For generic vector input, use `coding=Raster`, though the user can specify an output coding as desired.\n",
    "- `Dot`: A `Brick` that provides a dot product of two vectors.  While this could be updated in the future, right now the only implmentation is uses weights, and the analog value is the output of the brick. This is referred to as `current` output coding (to signify threshold operation).  You can then link this with other bricks that accept `current` to produce spikes.  Understand that we cannot do very much with a signal when it is in `current` coding.  This responsiblilty is left to the programmer.  Easy things to do would be, for example, add or multiply (we'd be able to write these bricks).\n",
    "- `Copy`: Another `Brick`.  Provides *n* (default 2) copies of the input signal in the same shape.  Each output is given its own output channel in the scaffold (see below).  We may be able to remove this brick in the future, but for now it is useful to prevent multiple bricks for adjusting the output of an upstream brick.\n",
    "- `Threshold`:  Another `Brick`.  Provides a basic thresholding.  Useful, for example, to perform a threshold which converts `current` coding into spikes. "

Most bricks provide one ouput channel; separate output channels allow for a brick to send separate output signals to separate bricks.  In this case, `Copy` provides two output channels coming from the same node (node number 1).  Below, we connect a different `Dot` brick to each of these output channels.  By default, a brick connects to the first output channel of a node if none is specified.  We also name them for fun!"
