        Generally, your brick will impart some coding, but that isn't the case here.
        All bricks should provide a neuron that spikes when the brick has completed processing.
        We just put in a basic relay neuron that will spike when it receives any spike from its
        single input, which is the complete_node from the first input.
        All nodes we add to the graph should have basic neuron parameters (threshold, decay)
        Reasonable defaults will be filled-in, but these defaults may depend on the execution platform.
        Additionally, nodes should have a field called 'index' which is a local index used to reference the
        position of the node.  This can be used by downstream bricks.  A simple example might be
        a 3-bit binary representation will add 3 nodes to the graph with indices 0,1,2
