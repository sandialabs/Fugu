Various types of bricks can be combined to construct a more sophisticated algorithm.  `Scaffold` is the main object for end-users.  The general workflow is something like this:\n",
    "    1. Define a `Scaffold` object\n",
    "    2. Attach bricks to the `Scaffold`, linking them together\n",
    "    3. 'Build' the computational graph by calling `Scaffold.lay_bricks`\n",
    "    4. Call `Scaffold.evaluate` and perform any post-processing to your answer.\n",
    "A few todo-type caveats:  \n",
    "    1. The `Scaffold` object should, itself, be a `Brick`.  This is critical but unfortunately currently missing.\n",
    "    2. Inputs that take both pre-computed values and input spikes may not lay correctly.\n",
    "    3. The code is missing a large portion of expected 'checks' so right now it is on the user to determine if they are doing something allowed or disallowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Spike_Input`: A `Brick` that provides spike inputs in the form of vectors.  For a single input, a numpy array (as you see below) is sufficient.  For inputs at various timesteps, use the flag `time_dimension`.  For generic vector input, use `coding=Raster`, though the user can specify an output coding as desired.\n",
    "- `Dot`: A `Brick` that provides a dot product of two vectors.  While this could be updated in the future, right now the only implementation is uses weights, and the analog value is the output of the brick. This is referred to as `current` output coding (to signify threshold operation).  You can then link this with other bricks that accept `current` to produce spikes.  Understand that we cannot do very much with a signal when it is in `current` coding.  This responsiblilty is left to the programmer.  Easy things to do would be, for example, add or multiply (we'd be able to write these bricks).\n",
    "- `Threshold`:  Another `Brick`.  Provides a basic thresholding.  Useful, for example, to perform a threshold which converts `current` coding into spikes. \n",

Below, we connect a different `Dot` brick to each of these pair (Reference_Image <> Test_Image); all on channel 0 (the first channel).  By default, a brick connects to the first output channel of a node if none is specified.  We also name them for fun and clarity.
