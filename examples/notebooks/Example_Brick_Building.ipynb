A full list of coding types can be found at `fugu.input_coding_types`.\n",

    "- control_nodes: A *dict* of *lists* of nodes that transmit a control information.  The most common is `control_nodes['complete']` which carries a list of 'finished' spikes from input bricks.  If your brick has one input, then this will be a list of a single node.  The only other currently used key is `control_nodes['begin']` which is used for temporally coded bricks (and outside the scope of this tutorial)\n",
